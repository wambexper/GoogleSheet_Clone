# GoogleSheet_Clone
Google Sheet Clone is a replica of Excell Google spread sheets used by companies in formulation, computation and presentation of data in a more informative and clear format.
I have majory majorly used the following technologies to build up the Google Sheet Clone
     1.Html for structuring the sheet pages
     2.Css for styling and making it attractive and Eye catching
     3.JavaScript for giving interactivity and making it moore responsive.
